# Categorizing-Inappropriate-Texts
Built a multi-label classification model that detects inappropriate texts and help us to further categorize them. We are using a kaggle dataset which contains Wikipedia comments, and we employed NLP techniques to extract features from this dataset. We have used Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression as our baseline models and SVM, Random Forest and Neural Networks as our advance models. Out of these, tuned Neural Network with feature engineering, text cleaning and oversampling gave the best results for us with a score of 0.7 (Using 60% Recall + 40% Precision).
