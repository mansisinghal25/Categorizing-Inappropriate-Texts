# Categorizing-Inappropriate-Texts
Built a multi-label classification model that detects inappropriate texts and help us to further categorize them. We have used a kaggle dataset which contains Wikipedia comments, and we employed NLP techniques to extract features from this dataset. 
### Baseline Models
* Naive Bayes 
* Logistic Regression 

### Advanced Models
* SVM
* Random Forest 
* Neural Networks

Out of these, tuned Neural Network with feature engineering, text cleaning and oversampling gave the best results for us with a score of 0.7 (Using 60% Recall + 40% Precision).
